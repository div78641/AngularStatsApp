# StatsApp

StatsApp was started as an exercised to accomplish two things:
* Answer the question: Are the 2018 Orioles the worst team in Major League Baseball when it comes to the number of runs scored per hit? (Interestingly this turned out to be no althought it feels like they need to get a lot more hits than all the other teams in order to score runs) And,
* Help me become more familiar with the Angular framework.

## How We Arrived Here
In order to answer the first question, I needed some way to get the stats into an application and crunch them. In researching the where questions, I found [MySportsFeeds](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/). If you are looking for a way to do something with sports data, they are a good choice.

I wanted to do this application quickly, so I thought of Angular and used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. And updated to the latest version of the Angular CLI during the course of development. To do the table sorting, I chose [Angular Material's data table](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview) and while that turned into a bigger challenge than I realised when choosing that technology, I did learn a lot. 

## Future Direction
I may add takes on the stats from the NHL, NFL and NBA.

I will eventually upgrade to version 2 of MySportsFeeds.

Possible updates due to Angular and Angular Material improvements.
