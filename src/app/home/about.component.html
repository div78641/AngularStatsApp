<h2>About StatsApp</h2>
<p>
  StatsApp was started as an exercised to accomplish two things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Answer the question: Are the 2018 Orioles the worst team in <a href="http://mlb.com" target="_blank">Major League Baseball</a> when it
    comes to the number of runs scored per hit? (Interestingly this turned out to be no althought it feels like they need to get a lot more
    hits than all the other teams in order to score runs) And,</li>
  <li>Help me become more familiar with the <a href="http://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular framework</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How We Arrived Here</h3>
<p>In order to answer the first question, I needed some way to get the stats into an application and crunch them. In researching
  the where questions, I found <a href="https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/" target="_blank">MySportsFeeds</a>. If you are looking
  for a way to do something with sports data, they are a good choice.</p>
<p>I wanted to do this application quickly, so I thought of Angular and used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>.</p>
<p>This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a> version 6.0.8 and then updated to the
  latest version of the Angular CLI during the course of development. To do the table sorting, I chose <a href="https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview">Angular
    Material's data table</a> and while that turned into a bigger challenge than I realised when choosing that technology,
  I did learn a lot. </p>
<h3>Future Direction</h3>
<p>I may add takes on the stats from the NHL, NFL and NBA.</p>
<p>I will eventually upgrade to version 2 of MySportsFeeds.</p>
<p>Possible updates due to Angular and Angular Material improvements.</p>
